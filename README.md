<h2>Contract creation:  </h2><br>

Contracts can come in a variety of types and behaviors, each designed to suit different investment goals and risk appetites. Here are some common types of contracts that users may encounter:

<b>Futures:</b> Futures contracts allow investors to buy or sell a specific asset at a predetermined price and date in the future. They are often used by traders looking to hedge against price fluctuations or speculate on the future value of an asset.<br><br>

<b>Options:</b> Options contracts give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price and date in the future. They are often used as a form of insurance or to generate income through selling options contracts.<br><br>

<b>Tokens:</b> Token contracts are a type of smart contract that can represent a variety of assets, such as digital tokens or shares of a company. They are often used in initial coin offerings (ICOs) or other forms of fundraising, and can be designed to distribute rewards or voting rights to token holders.<br><br>

<b>Crowdfunding</b>: Crowdfunding contracts allow multiple investors to contribute funds towards a specific project or venture. They are often used to raise money for startups or social causes, and can provide investors with a share of the profits or rewards associated with the project.<br><br>
